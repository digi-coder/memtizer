        <h1>Memtizer Terms &amp; Service Policies</h1>
        <p class="legal-intro">
          Memtizer is a local video digitizing service based in North Hollywood, California.
          We aim to treat your tapes with care and be transparent about how we work.
          This page explains our general service terms and policies.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
          <p>
            Memtizer provides tape-to-digital conversion services for consumer video formats such as
            VHS, PAL VHS, Hi8 / Video8, Digital8, and MiniDV. We serve North Hollywood and nearby
            areas through local drop-off by appointment, shipping, and optional local pickup for an additional fee.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>2. Scope of Service</h2>
          <p>
            Our standard service is to convert supported tape formats to MP4 video files and deliver them
            via USB drive, external drive, or secure cloud link. We do not provide full video editing,
            color grading, or major restoration as part of standard pricing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some tapes may require additional work such as cleaning, mechanical repair, or other preparation
            before they can be safely played. These services are considered <strong>extras</strong> and are quoted
            separately if needed.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>3. Pricing, Quotes &amp; Payment</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Prices shown on the website are for typical, playable tapes in reasonable condition.
            </li>
            <li>
              We review your tapes at drop-off (or after receiving shipped tapes) and confirm pricing
              before starting any work. If we find issues that may affect cost, we will discuss them with
              you first.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rush options, local pickup, extra-long tapes, repairs, and cleaning may incur additional fees.
            </li>
            <li>
              Payment is due as agreed at the time of drop-off, pickup, or upon completion of the project.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>4. Your Responsibilities</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You confirm that you own the tapes you provide or have the right to request them to be digitized.
            </li>
            <li>
              You agree not to submit media that is illegal to possess, copy, or view under applicable law.
            </li>
            <li>
              You agree to provide honest information about the condition of your tapes, especially if there
              is known mold, water damage, or severe brittleness.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>5. Tape Condition, Risk &amp; Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            Many tapes we work with are decades old and may have age-related issues such as dropouts,
            stretching, oxide shedding, or physical damage. We take reasonable, professional care with all
            media, but some risks cannot be fully eliminated.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Tapes with mold, heavy residue, warped shells, or severe brittleness may require specialized
              restoration work and are not handled under standard digitizing service.
            </li>
            <li>
              In some cases, attempting to play a heavily degraded tape may cause it to snap, shed, or fail
              during playback despite careful handling.
            </li>
            <li>
              We cannot guarantee that damaged or severely aged tapes will be fully recoverable or that
              the final image or sound quality will match your expectations.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If a tape is clearly unsafe to run in equipment, we will stop and contact you with options
            (such as repair, cleaning, or declining the transfer). If a tape fails despite reasonable care,
            our liability is limited to the cost of the services we charged for that tape. We do not reimburse
            for sentimental value or replace original media.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>6. Turnaround Times</h2>
          <p>
            Typical turnaround for most projects is approximately 3–7 business days from the time we
            have received your tapes and confirmed the quote, depending on quantity and current workload.
            Larger projects or jobs requiring extra cleaning, repairs, or troubleshooting may take longer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rush or same-week service may be available for an additional fee and must be arranged in advance.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>7. File Delivery, Storage &amp; Deletion</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You can receive your digital files on a USB drive, external drive, or via a secure cloud link.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unless otherwise agreed, we delete working copies of your files after you have received them
              and confirmed that everything looks good, or after a reasonable period of time.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you request cloud delivery, links may have an expiration window (for example, 30 days)
              after which files are no longer available for download unless you arrange ongoing storage.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We recommend that you keep multiple backups of your delivered files (for example, an external
            drive and a cloud backup) to protect against future data loss.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>8. Local Pickup &amp; Shipping</h2>
          <p>
            For local customers, we offer drop-off by appointment and an optional paid local pickup service
            within our stated service area. Pickup and delivery fees are listed on our Pricing page and may
            depend on distance and order size.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you choose to ship your tapes to us, you are responsible for packing, labeling, and insuring
            your shipment. We are not responsible for media that is lost or damaged in transit to or from
            our location. We recommend using a trackable, insured shipping method.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your tapes are especially important to you, some customers choose to place an Apple AirTag or similar
            tracker inside their package and temporarily share tracking with us. This is optional but can provide
            extra peace of mind during transit.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>9. Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            We do not sell or share your contact details with third parties for marketing purposes.
            Your tapes and digital files are only accessed as needed to complete your transfer and quality
            checks. We do not view your content beyond what is necessary to verify that the transfer worked
            correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you contact us through the website form, we will use your name, email, phone, and project
            details only to respond to your request and manage your project.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
          <p>
            We may update these terms and policies from time to time to reflect changes in our services
            or applicable law. The version posted on this page is the current version. If you have an
            ongoing project, we will honor the terms that applied when you booked your job, unless we
            mutually agree otherwise.
